### Tips

If you're interested in running the Java programs from inside the terminal console, you need to make these steps:

For the sake of example, let's assume that the class file is called `Main.java` and it is inside the package called `exercise`.

1. Compile the class file.
```console
javac Main.java
```

2. Compile whole package, bear in mind the `-d .` flag used to set the destination of compiled package
```console
javac -d . Main.java
```

3. Run the program
```console
java exercise.Main
```
